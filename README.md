LaTeX Installation:

To use LaTeX, you need two things: a LaTeX distribution; a text editor. The distribution is just the set of programs that comprise LaTeX. The text editor is where you write your commands and text. 

Windows: the LaTeX distribution is called MikTeX - http://miktex.org/2.9/setup
There are lots of editors - one really good one is Winedt, but there are many. 

Mac: the LaTeX distribution is TeX Live. Go to the MacTeX users group at http://www.tug.org/mactex/index.html and download. This will install LaTeX (TeX Live) and a very good text editor called TeXShop - it also provides a bibliography management database called BibDesk which is also quite good. As with Windows, there are lots of editors, so choose what you like. 

Here is a list of lots of editors - note that this list doesn't distinguish Mac/Windows.

There are lots of guides to LaTeX on the web - here are links to just a few of them:
